# Business Card Generator

## Overview
The **Business Card Generator** is a simple GUI application that allows users to create and 
customize their own business cards. The user can input their name, job title, phone number, and 
email, and the program generates a business card using a predefined background image and adds 
the text onto the image. The final product is saved as a PNG file.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI to input business card details (name, job title, phone number, email).
- Generates a business card with a custom background image.
- Saves the generated card as a PNG file.
- Uses the `Pillow` library for image processing and Tkinter for the GUI.
